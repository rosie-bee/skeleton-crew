# skeleton-crew
Releases for the text-based game, Skeleton Crew (still very WIP)

A learning project for me personally to familiarize myself with Python as a language, as my main used is MATLAB.
Incredibly rough and WIP, all I'm aiming for is a functional product.

You'll need Python 3.10 and the Colorama library in order to run this game.

Completed features:
- Practice loop
- Inividualized NPCs & Stats
- Scrimmage Mechanics
- Inspect Command

Upcoming Features:
- Events
- Season Change
- New NPCs
- Inventory system
- More lore
- Cosmic Horror
