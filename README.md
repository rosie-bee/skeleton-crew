# skeleton-crew
Releases for the text-based game, Skeleton Crew (still very WIP)

A learning project for me personally to familiarize myself with Python as a language, as my main used is MATLAB.
Incredibly rough and WIP, all I'm aiming for is a functional product.

You'll need Python 3.10 and the Colorama library in order to run this game.
DOWNLOAD PYTHON ONLY FROM THE OFFICIAL SITE TO GET THE PIP LIBRARY
To install Colorama, open python and type "pip install colorama" into the terminal.

Check the new-release-beta folder to get the most up-to-date version of the game!
